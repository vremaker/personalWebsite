        <h1> Meet Night Owl </h1>
        <p>
          This project spanned 11 weeks in our HCDE 318 (Introduction to User
          Centered Design) course, in Autumn 2019. As a team of 4, we applied
          the user centered design process to the problem area of the danger
          of walking alone at night for students. The process culminated in a
          mobile application called NightOwl that gives students confidence and
          control when walking alone at night.

      <h2> Problem Statement </h2>
       <img src="opti/ps-min.png" alt="picture of person in the night with the text:  University District is known to be a sketchy neighborhood. For example, the Safeway northwest of campus is fondly called Sketchway by students. This brings up the concern that walking near campus at night can be dangerous for students; students should not have to be concerned with their safety when walking around their university. This problem resonates with our team and peers, which is why we wanted to tackle the area of how to help students feel safe and confident walking near UW’s campus during night"/>

      <h2> Interviews </h2>
      <p>
        Our research consisted of three different methods: semi-structured
        interview, “fly on the wall” observation, and competitive analysis.
        Through these methods, we learned more about our user group and their
        goals and pain points as well as other products already on the market.
  
        <br/>
        Each team member conducted a one-on-one interview with a student at the
        University of Washington that walks during dusk or at night at least
        4 times a month. We then regrouped and synthesized our findings into
        key takeaways that would help us define our problem space and user group.
        <p><em class="heading">Key Takeaways</em></p>
        <ul>
          <li>- They felt more comfortable talking with a friend on the phone when walking alone </li>
          <li>- Walking home alone is unavoidable </li>
          <li>- They know about UW safety, but doesn’t know how it works</li>
          <li>- They are very aware of their surroundings </li>

        Each team member conducted one competitive analysis on an existing safety
        app. This allowed us to understand how existing products on the market meet
        users’ needs and how they could be improved. We analyzed the apps BSafe,
        Circle of 6, Sekura, and Noonlight. Overall, the apps all had streamlined
        designs that generally made users feel safe, but also had shortcomings
        such as confusing features and allowing users to easily trigger emergency
        services on accident. We used this information to seek opportunities,
        inspire our designs, and learn what to avoid.

        experienced with the UDistrict area and one that was only semi-familiar
        with the area. This let us understand different user perspectives. Our

        These requirements ensured that our solution solved user pain points
        and satisfied their goals. In addition, they helped us decide to focus on
        creating a phone app as our final product because it would be able to
        fulfill the requirements. This would also be convenient for our users
        since we observed that many of them interacted with their phone in some
        way while walking at night.

    <div id="pp" class="page">
      <h2> Paper Prototype Usability Testing</h2>
      <p>
        The paper prototypes were a quick, easy way to test our designed features
        without distracting users with colors and photos. They helped us
        pinpoint confusing and unintuitive aspects of our initial features,
        which we incorporated into our redesign. First, we each individually
        sketched and described three interfaces. Then, we came back together
        and combined our rough draft sketches into consistent interface sketches
        for our usability tests. Based on our storyboards and information
        architecture diagram, we defined three key tasks that we asked users
        to complete in our tests.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Task 1:  </em><br /> User searches for a final destination, which will be home.
        Then they will select the path that they want to take and start their
        route.
        <br /><br />
        <em>Task 2: </em> <br /> User reports a burglary incident and inputs the correct
        information (date, time, description) and submits it. After submitting,
        check that it was successfully added to the map.
        <br /><br />
        <em>Task 3: </em>  <br />User adds new safety contact and then calls them.
        <br /><br />
      </p>

      <p> <em>Try out these tasks with our virtual paper prototype </em> </p>
      <p>
        <em> Participants:</em> We tested our prototype with four female University of
        Washington students who walk alone at night at least once a week.
        <br /><br/>
        <em>Method:</em> For each evaluation, we followed three major phases of testing in order to cohesively gather quality information about our users and our app. The first phase started off with an interview with each participant in order to gather basic demographic information. The second phase consisted of the main usability testing by providing users with a task that they had to accomplish while observers recorded notes. During the test, we asked participants to think out loud so that we could better understand their thought process and pain points. To make it seem like a real application, we used a Marvel App to conduct our usability testing. Lastly, we performed a post test interview to get final details of what participants thought of their experience of our solution to night safety.
        After individually completing our usability tests, we came back together to synthesize and analyze our findings. We found commonalities in the features users struggled with, strengths and weaknesses of our design, and suggestions for redesign.
      <br/><br />
        <em class="heading"> Key Findings: </em>
        <ul>
          <li>- Users wanted to be able to share their location even when they hadn't started a path. </li>
          <li>- Users did not expect the app to immediately call a contact after clicking on their contact tile. </li>
          <li>- Users want to be able to quickly input information when reporting a hazard. </li>
          <li>- Users stated that hazards have different urgency levels, which should be reflected in the app.</li>

    <!-- Refinement -->
    <div id="refine" class="page">
      <h2> Refinements </h2>
      <p>
        Based on our findings from our usability tests we made some changes to our designs.
        Below are the  three main changes that we made based on user feedback.
      </p>
      <h4>Report a Hazard Screen</h4>
      <img src="opti/hazGlow-min.png" alt="hazards page glow up"/>
      <p> <em>
        Having different icon categories and hazard types was confusing, but users
        still wanted hazards to be differentiated in some way. We made a few
        changes based on this feedback: </em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>- Removed different icon types and only allowed users to report hazards</li>
        <li>- Removed hazard types</li>
        <li> - Allowed users to enter a title for the hazard</li>
        <li> - Added hazard levels (low, medium, and high danger) </li>
      </ul>
  
      <br>
      <h4>Calling Safety Contact Screen</h4>
      <img src="opti/contGlow-min.png" alt="contacts glow up "/>
      <p><em>  When users tapped on a contact, they expected to be taken to an editing page instead of it calling them, so we: </em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>- Added a “call” button so that users would know that tapping it would immediately call the contact</li>
        <li> - Tapping on the contact’s picture would bring them to the editing page </li>
      </ul>
  
      <br>
      <h4>Select Route Screen</h4>
      <img src="opti/minGlow-min.png" alt="minimized map view"/>

        <em>We made a few minor changes to this screen to alleviate confusion: </em>

      <ul>
          <li> - Added “start route” button to collapsed menu </li>
        <li> - Moved “start route” button to the side </li>
        <li> - Added “From” text field at the top <li>

    <!--Wireframes-->
    <div id="wf" class="page">
      <h2> Annotated Wire Frames </h2>
      <p>
        Also based on our usability testing feedback, we redesigned and
        added aspects to our wireframes. Then, looking back at our information
        architecture, we created the app's full functionality in Figma. These
        wireframes were supposed to be low fidelity without color and real
        text in order to strictly communicate the app’s features. We annotated
        each screen to highlight key components and describe functionality.
        This step helped us think about how our features worked together and
        was a useful way to get feedback before designing our high fidelity
        prototypes.

    <!--Final Product-->
    <div id="final"class="page">
        <h2> High Fidelity Prototype </h2>
        <p>
          Based on all our research and testing, we created an app called NightOwl,
          that students could use to feel safe when walking alone at night.
          The app has two main components: safety circle and map.
          <br /><br />
          In the safety circle, based on interviewees stating they feel
          comfortable when they’re walking and talking to their friend,
          users are able to quickly and easily call their friends. If their
          friends are busy, users can call the bot. The bot will record and
          talk to them, mimicking a ‘friend’ listening to you in case your
          are in a dangerous situation.
          <br /><br />
          On the map, users can select a destination and the safest path to get
          there. Once the user starts their route, their safety contacts will be
          alerted and the app will automatically send another notification when
          the user gets to their final destination; this happens automatically
          because it’s easy to forget to let your friends know you got home safe.
          To keep the incidents up to date on the map, we use crowdsourcing;
          users can report and confirm hazards.
          <br /><br />
          After user feedback, we made
          the SOS button be easily clickable, which brings up a popup that
          counts down from 5 seconds and then calls 911. If the user accidently
          pressed the SOS button, they can easily cancel it. But we learned
          that it’s important the SOS button be very quick to use in case
          of a dire situation.
          <br /><br />
          For our colors, we chose dark mode because users would be using this
          app at night, so we wanted the screen to be subdued. Our color scheme
          is dark blue, bright orange, and bright red. It is important to create
          high contrast to show key information. Orange represents important
          actionable items such as reporting a hazard and starting route.
          The bright red is used only for the SOS button to ensure it stands
          out in case of emergency.

        Overall, this project was challenging and definitely stretched our
        thinking in both design and teamwork. Working with a group to create
        a high-fidelity mockup for a product in just 11 weeks was difficult
        and required hard work from everyone. We learned that designing with a

        <ul>
          <em class="heading"> Outline of what we would do differently/with more time: </em>
          <li> - More user research and usability testing  </li>
          <li>
            - Explore optimizing map pathfinding for users going between the
            same two places multiple times a week
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        If we had more time, we definitely would have conducted more user research
        and usability testing. Specifically, it would have been useful to do
        competitive analysis on other technologies and services rather than just
        apps. Also, although a phone app fit our design requirements,
        we didn’t have much time to think about alternative forms of our
        final product. We definitely would’ve wanted to explore other options,
        especially since our user group of students walking at night should
        actually be discouraged from using their phones.
        <br /><br />
        In addition, there were parts of our app that we want to test more
        because we are unsure of their effectiveness or usefulness. One of
        these functions is the SOS button; we had gotten a lot of feedback about
        how to make it easily accessible while not making it easy to accidentally
        trigger. Based on user feedback, we were able to incorporate a solution
        into our final design, but we would want to test with more users. However,
        it was difficult to actually test the true functionality of the SOS
        button because it’s meant to be used in emergency situations. Another
        feature that we were unsure about was the ability to call a Bot. Some of
        our users said that they would feel weird talking to a Bot and wouldn’t
        use it, while some said they would. With more time, we would’ve wanted
        to figure out how to make this feature truly useful to our users.
        <br /><br />
        One really interesting question we received was about our research
        into how often our users were going between the same two points every
        week, and how we can optimize our map function to those users. This
        question was very thought-provoking; since one of our features was
        pathfinding on a map, we immediately turned to pre-existing solutions
        (e.g. Google Maps, Apple Maps) as a base. However,
        these solutions are made to deal with someone starting
        from anywhere and going to anywhere. Dealing with the situation of
        users going between the same two points multiple times a week might
        result in a completely different solution. If we had the time, we would
        want to explore optimization for this specific situation.

        <br />
      <p>  <em>Finally, here are some key takeaways from each of us: </em>
        <br /><br />
        <em>Maya: </em>At the end of the project, I was surprised by how much a
        “final” design can still be improved. It was a little disheartening
        seeing how much critique our (almost) final design received, but when
        I thought about it, pretty much every design in the world can be improved
        in some way.
        <br /><br />
        <em>Lia:</em> I learned how to optimize time and create quality work
        by understanding and using each team mate’s skills and passions.
        At different steps in our process, each one of us went above and
        beyond to help the project excel.
        <br /><br />
          <em> Peter: </em> Overall, this experience from start to finish has been memorable.
        I enjoyed collaborating with my teammates as we each had important
        contributions to NightOwl. As for the project itself, we may have
        finished the first iteration of the high fidelity prototype, but there is
        still much improvements we can make, especially after our final critique.
        <br /><br />
        <em> Valerie: </em> This has been one of the most incredible design experiences
        I have had. I love working in groups to design artifacts rather than trying to design
        something complex like NightOwl on your own. I loved watching our project grow as we
        shared ideas and made compromises about our designs. Each member of the team brought
        something very unique to the table, and although it was challenging to incorporate what worked
        best for all of us, it was in this diversity of the designers in our group that we were able
        to produce a product that we are all proud of.
